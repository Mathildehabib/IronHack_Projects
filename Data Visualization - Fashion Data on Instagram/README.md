## Data Visualization - Fashion Data on Instagram

#### Technical Goal
The aim of this project is to train our new data visualization skills.  
Creating different plots via Python Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn in order to highlight some ideas.  

#### Analytics Goal
The purpose of this analysis is to find some correlations between what we would have thought would have an impact on the reactivity of the audience; and find some conclusions on the fakeness of marketing on social medias (via Instagram).  
On this analysis, we split the data in two : df and df2 will represent all the users from 0 to millions followers and data2 will represent 
the influencers having between 15k and 300k followers.
