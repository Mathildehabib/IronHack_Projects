Web scraping Project
=

## Technical goal
The aim of this project is to train the web scraping skills, learned during the last week.  
The data analysed in this project should be scraped from at least one website.  

## Analytics goal
For this project, I decided to compare the average prices over two websites : The Outnet and Net-à-Porter.  
Those two lxury marketplaces are from the same company. On both websites you can find the same designers and the same kind of products.  
Basically, The Outnet is the outlet part of Net-à-Porter.   


So what we wanna know is "do they inflate original prices on The Outnet, in order to cheat on the reduction rates?".  
To answer this question, we will compare the average prices per category on those websites.
