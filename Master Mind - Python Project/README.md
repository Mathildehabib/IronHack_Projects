# Project: Master Mind

## Overview

The goal of this project is to apply the Python programming skills learned during the first week in solving a real problem. The goal is to develop the game using Python based on the game design.

Here are the game narratives and technical requirements. 
First step was to write the pseudo codes and draw the flowchart. 
Then review the logic and process in order to avoid potential errors.
Eventually implement with Python code that you will find in this folder

## Game Narratives

2 players (here you play against the computer)

The purpose of the game is to find the SECRET CODE which is a combination of 4 DIFFERENT colors, randomly chosen by the computer.
#### Please find below all the different possible colors :
